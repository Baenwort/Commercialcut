# Commercialcut
Repository for commercial cutting software for EmbyTV
The credit for this process belongs to bollar on the Freenas (and probably Plex) forum and warrentc3 on the Emby and Plex forums.  They worked out all the kinks and provided a great process for cutting commercials using a postprocessing shell script.
